    # This command could be "beautifully" lazy like the commented line below,
    # but for some reason on GitHub Actions specifically (and nowhere else I
    # could find) it logs the following warnings:
    #
    #     tr: write error: Broken pipe
    #     tr: write error
    #     base64: write error: Broken pipe
    #     base64: write error
    #
    # Even though it still succeeds and behaves properly, I'd rather not have
    # those warnings show up, so I use `head` twice, getting 16 bytes off
    # `/dev/urandom`, Base64-encoding it (which should give us 25 characters),
    # and we drop all the nonalphanumeric ones and trim it to 16 chars.
    #
    password=$(head -c 16 /dev/urandom | base64 | tr -cd '[:alnum:]' | head -c 16)
    # password=$(base64 < /dev/urandom | tr -cd '[:alnum:]' | head -c16)
